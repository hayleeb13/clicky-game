# clicky-game

* This project is an interactive React app.
* The program displays 12 different images and the score goes up when a user clicks on them.
* If the user clicks on the same image twice the score resets. Each time an image is clicked the images shuffle positions.
* The project is useful because it allows someone to test their memory and have fun at the same time.
* Simply get started by using the deployed app or running npm start.
* Any questions or issues regarding this program can be directed to Haylee Bell
